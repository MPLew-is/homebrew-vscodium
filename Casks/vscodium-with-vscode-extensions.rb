  # Since we previously forced auto-updating off, we need to alert users about the new functionality.
  # We don't want to blindly turn auto-updating back on in case the user doesn't want that for other reasons.
  caveats 'With the latest versions of VSCodium, extensions gallery override settings and auto-updating can now coexist; if you want to turn auto-updating back on, remove the `update.mode` setting from your `settings.json` file.'
